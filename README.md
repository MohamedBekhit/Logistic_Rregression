# Logistic_Rregression
This is a machine learning practice project.

This project is a two parter:
1. Classification model that estimates the probability that an applicant would be admitted in a certain university based on the applicant's score in two exams, using a logistic regression model trained on a set of hestorical data of the scores of applicants accepted the past years.

2. Given the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, it is required to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help make the decision, a dataset of test results on past microchips is given, with which a logistic regression model can be trained and implemented.
